		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>These chocolate chocolate chip cookies are made with cocoa powder and chocolate chips to guarantee chocolaty flavor in every bite. My kids love them!</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
    		<li>Sugar: The recipe starts with 1 ½ cups white sugar.</li>
    		<li>Butter: Beat the sugar with two sticks of softened butter.</li>
    		<li>Eggs: Two eggs lend moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
    		<li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chocolate chip cookies.</li>
    		<li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the cookie dough structure.</li>
    		<li>Cocoa powder: They wouldn’t be chocolate chocolate chip cookies without cocoa powder!</li>
    		<li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
    		<li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won’t make the cookies taste salty.</li>
    		<li>Chocolate chips: You’ll need two cups of semisweet chocolate chips.</li>
    		<li>Walnuts (optional): Walnuts are optional, but they add welcome crunch.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
    		<li>Beat the wet ingredients in one bowl and the dry ingredients in another.</li>

    		<li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are set.</li>
